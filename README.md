use time series methods to predict Canadian bankruptcy rate


Problem Statement
Accurately forecasting national bankruptcy rates has always been a primary interest to
national banks, insurance companies, credit-lenders, politicians, etc. With the
development of global economy, the bankruptcy rate in Canada saw a steady rise. From
“Bankruptcy Canada”1, one in six adults in Canada face bankruptcy. The most important
reason behind this problem is they borrow money from bank but cannot pay off the debt.
Since loans are very important earning asset for banks, an accurate forecast of the
national bankruptcy rate is desired. The goal of this project is to develop a model that
accurately predicts monthly bankruptcy rate in Canada from January 2011 to December
2012, based on historical data from January 1987 to December 2010.
